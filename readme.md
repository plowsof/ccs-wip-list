and mj has already completed most of his work for M3+M4 already, so after that it's pretty much just my part
of M3+M4 left. Unfortunately there have been some delays on my part (had some personal stuff to deal with in
the last few months), so I doubt that I'll be able to finish my part in time for the original deadline, but
rest assured that I (we) intend to

## FUNDING ISSUE
- [Decentralizing Molly.im to support Monero payments](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/vd-molly-payments-stage1.html)  
    - https://github.com/mollyim/monero-wallet-sdk
    - [valldrac](https://libera.monerologs.net/monero-community/20221202#c171460): "It's progressing well, but slowly. I have published already part of the Monero library I'm developing to use in Molly. Soon I will release a demo app that implements a Monero wallet for Android using this library, to test and validate it. My idea is that the library become part of the Monero ecosystem. This goal not planned at the beginning, but I think it makes sense"

## PURGATORY
- [Archive Monero Github code on a self-host onion instance and sia network](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/Archive-monero-code-in-uncensorable-way.html) Offline 20221106 0.2 XMR remains
    - After looking into the 'Sia network' it is not actually censorship resistant per this [tw*tter thread](https://nitter.cz/davidvorick/status/1500342996998529026?lang=en)
    - The process involves buying Siacoins(?) and paying fees with them [more info here](https://docs.sia.tech/renting/how-to-rent-storage-on-sia) 
    - IMO this ccs was a none starter, considering the trust involved of hosting the 'one source' of truth, combined with the Sia network not actually censorship resistant - but it was popular as it came right after the tornado cash incident.
