    - [10-06-22 17:05:58](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/739#issuecomment-1270463283) <dangerousfreedom> First of all thank you very much for your donations! I will do my best to deliver a high quality job as proposed. This week I have been investigating the grootle proofs in seraphis. I have been trying to make a parallel implementation of it in order to better understand how it works, to correct some possible flaws (if I find any) and to facilitate the work of someone else who is going to audit before going to production
    - [10-12-2022 17:05:03](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/740#issuecomment-1276549475) <dangerousfreedom> Hello. I'm still going on through all the math equations in Seraphis and working on the audits framework.
    - [10-19-2022 17:06:32](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/743#issuecomment-1284379262) <dangerousfreedom> I'm working on my understanding of wallet2 and simplewallet and trying to create some logical reasoning of what is going on there.

    - [11-09-2022 17:05:24](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/750#issuecomment-1309172744) <dangerousfreedom> I'm working on opening a jamtis/seraphis wallet compatible with the wallet2. Maybe I will have something to present next week.

    - [12-05-2022](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/762#issuecomment-1338007193)<dangerousfreedom> rbrunner7[m]: This week I looked at the checksum algo and implemented the BCH code as specified by Tevador in his Python snippet (https://github.com/DangerousFreedom1984/seraphis_lib/blob/simple_prototype/src/seraphis/jamtis_account.cpp#L186) so if we reach a consensus about the address tag (which I dont have an opinion now) then we should be good for generating the addresses. I have also been looking at the transaction proofs and should write something (to Koe) by the weekend.

and mj has already completed most of his work for M3+M4 already, so after that it's pretty much just my part
of M3+M4 left. Unfortunately there have been some delays on my part (had some personal stuff to deal with in
the last few months), so I doubt that I'll be able to finish my part in time for the original deadline, but
rest assured that I (we) intend to

    - dev tax removed / endor can finish the project without mj

- [Decentralizing Molly.im to support Monero payments](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/vd-molly-payments-stage1.html)  
    - https://github.com/mollyim/monero-wallet-sdk
    - [valldrac](https://libera.monerologs.net/monero-community/20221202#c171460): "It's progressing well, but slowly. I have published already part of the Monero library I'm developing to use in Molly. Soon I will release a demo app that implements a Monero wallet for Android using this library, to test and validate it. My idea is that the library become part of the Monero ecosystem. This goal not planned at the beginning, but I think it makes sense"

## PURGATORY
- [Archive Monero Github code on a self-host onion instance and sia network](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/Archive-monero-code-in-uncensorable-way.html) Offline 20221106 0.2 XMR remains
    - After looking into the 'Sia network' it is not actually censorship resistant per this [tw*tter thread](https://nitter.cz/davidvorick/status/1500342996998529026?lang=en)
    - The process involves buying Siacoins(?) and paying fees with them [more info here](https://docs.sia.tech/renting/how-to-rent-storage-on-sia) 
    - IMO this ccs was a none starter, considering the trust involved of hosting the 'one source' of truth, combined with the Sia network not actually censorship resistant - but it was popular as it came right after the tornado cash incident.
